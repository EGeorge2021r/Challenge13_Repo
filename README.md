To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful using a deep neural network

## User Story
Role: Risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm.

Goal: Create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

Reason: Alphabet Soup’s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, the task is to decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

## General information
The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. 




## Technology
Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations %matplotlib inline Python


## Libraries used in the analysis
The following libraries were imported and used in the project. import pandas as pd import holoviews as hv from fbprophet import Prophet import hvplot.pandas import datetime as dt %matplotlib inline


## Analysis and Visualisation
Identify unusual patterns in time series data by using Pandas and other tools. Mine for patterns in seasonality by using the hvPlot visualization tool. Build sales-forecast and user-interest predictive models for the firm by using Facebook Prophet.


## Deliverables

This project consists of three technical deliverables as follows:
• Preprocess data for use on a neural network model.
• Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
• Optimize the neural network model.
